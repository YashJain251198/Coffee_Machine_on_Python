# Coffee_Machine_on_Python
Project
In this Coffe Machine Project, your task is to implement the logic (starting from a simple class) that translates orders from customers 
of the coffee machine to the drink maker. Your code will use the drink maker protocol to send commands to the drink maker.


Important !
You do not have to implement the coffee machine customer interface. For instance, your code could consume a simple POJO that would represent an order from a customer.

You do not have to implement the drink maker. It is only a imaginery engine that will receive messages according to the protocol. Your job is to build those messages.

Iterations
This project starts simple and will grow in added features through the iterations.

First iteration: Making Drinks (~30 minutes)
Second iteration: Going into business (~20 minutes)
Third iteration: Extra hot (~20 minutes)
Fourth iteration: Making money (~20 minutes)
Fifth iteration: Running out (~20 minutes)
